	- check the fake book tune.
	- check the fake book lyrics.
	- heard the fake book version.
	TODO:
	- this song has two poets one for the original portugese and one for english. This is not reflected in the output,
		make it not so.
	- in the real book version of the chords in the B section the des:7 should come in the middle of the bar and I
		have no way to indicate that. The original real book score does indicate that using tempo markings.
		Find out how to do that in lilypond and do it.
	REMARKS:
	- this tune was written in the real book under a C major scale (or A minor scale) where the B is always flat.
		Obviously this is a serious mistake.
